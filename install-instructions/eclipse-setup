* Eclipse setup
- Download Eclipse installer online
- Tested with version 2020-12

* If you have not already, switch to the fuzzing branch of the code
- This contains the SAFEMUV specific content for the fuzzing engine, operations etc
 
cd ~/academic/atlas/atlas-middleware
git checkout --track origin/fuzzing
git pull

* Upon switching to the fuzzing branch of the code, it is necessary to rebuild ATLASDBInterface
- This is because ATLASDBInterface was changed to report information needed for
  fuzzing (the source component from MOOS)
  
cd /home/safemuv/academic/atlas/atlas-middleware/custom-moos
./build-ivp.sh
cp bin/ATLASDBInterface ~/source/moos-ivp/bin

* Install Eclipse via the installer (2020-12)
Select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
Install to selected path
/home/safemuv/eclipse/java-2020-12
Accept License

Setup workspace at ~/eclipse-workspace

Add to .bashrc
export PATH=/home/safemuv/eclipse/java-2020-12/eclipse:$PATH

It can now be started via "eclipse" from the command prompt

* Import the project
- With the "fuzzing" branch, should be possible to import the project as a Maven project

Select "import projects" from the Package Explorer
Select Maven / Existing Maven Projects
Select browser and choose /home/safemuv/academic/atlas/atlas-middleware/middleware-java,
which contains pom.xml

* Install Java JRE
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre-headless maven

* Right click on project com.github.safemuv.platform
  Right click, select Build Path / Configure Build Path
  Remove any libraries that are not found from the build path
  Select Project / Clean and it should be OK
  There may be residual errors in RepeatedRunner and SAFEMUVEvaluationProblem
  
* Create Run configurations
  Select Run Configurations, Java Application -> "New Launch configuration" icon
  Name it "ATLAS-Middleware"
  Set Main class "middleware.core.ATLASMain"
  Set Arguments tab, under "Program arguments" enter "nofault gui"
  This selects no fault definitions, and to show the middleware GUI

  Select Run Configurations, Java Application -> "New Launch configuration" icon
  Name it "ATLAS-CI"
  Set Main class "atlascollectiveintgenerator.runner.CollectiveIntRunner"

* To start the platform
  Invoke ~/start_activemq.sh in the home dir
  Start a terminal and change to ~/academic/atlas/atlas-middleware/middleware-java/moos-sim
  Then start the middleware run configuration (ATLAS-Middleware)
  Invoke launch.sh in the terminal to start MOOS
  Then invoke the CI with the ATLAS-CI run configuration
  When finished use ./terminate.sh to terminate MOOS processes
  
* TODO Installing all the specific eclipse plugins
* TODO Code and fuzzing engine generation run configurations
